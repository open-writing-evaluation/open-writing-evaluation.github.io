System workflow of integrated AES and GEC for language learners. A user flow can be applied to simulate examination situations: the language learners receive instant objective scoring results and corrective feedback.

Interface screenshot for AES and GEC results: tokens in the faded red rectangles have been deleted; tokens in the green rectangles are corresponding grammatical corrections inserted by GEC; AES scores are scaled to 0-100.
